 Okay! It's time to learn Taekwondo! Please follow below steps.
 
 - Experiment:
 Run code! Let's learn Taekwondo at home.
    1. Generate playground for WWDC Swift Student Challenge.
    2. Call `letsLearn(taekwondo:)` method.
    3. Change the value of the parameter named `taekwondo`. If you want to see all actions, assign the value `.all`
 
 While learning Taekwondo, you can pause and play the action and move the model to another place.
 
 - Note:
 Tap the model to pause and play the action. In AR mode, drag the model to another place.

 - Example:
 ```
 let playground = WWDC.SwiftStudentChallenge
 playground.letsLearn(taekwondo: .all, in: .modeAR)
 ````

// CODE HERE
let playground = WWDC.SwiftStudentChallenge
playground.letsLearn(taekwondo: .all)
